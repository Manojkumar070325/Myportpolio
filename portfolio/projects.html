      <h2>Super Store Sales Management System</h2>
      <p>
        A Database Management System (DBMS)-based project designed to efficiently handle store operations.
        The system stores and manages critical data such as product details, inventory levels, sales transactions,
        customer information, and supplier records. It enables store administrators to perform essential tasks
        like adding new products, updating stock, tracking sales, generating bills, and producing detailed sales reports.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Features:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Centralized database for all store data.</li>
        <li>Add, update, and delete product details.</li>
        <li>Track and manage inventory in real-time.</li>
        <li>Record customer purchases and generate bills.</li>
        <li>Maintain supplier and sales history.</li>
        <li>Generate daily, monthly, and yearly sales reports.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
      <p><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL / PostgreSQL<br>
         <strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS<br>
         <strong>Backend:</strong> PHP / Java / Python</p>

      <h2>Weather Prediction using SARIMA and Baseline Models</h2>
      <p>
        Developed an end-to-end weather prediction system focused on forecasting temperature and humidity trends using the
        Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. Collected and preprocessed historical weather data to identify seasonal patterns and
        trends critical for accurate forecasting. Implemented and fine-tuned the SARIMA model for optimal performance, and
        conducted a comprehensive evaluation by comparing its predictions against baseline methods such as naive forecasting
        and moving average models.
      </p>

      <p>
        Applied feature engineering techniques to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy and performed detailed error analysis using
        RMSE and MAE metrics. Leveraged Python and data analysis libraries like Pandas to build, test, and validate the model,
        resulting in a robust and scalable time series forecasting solution.
      </p>

      <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
      <p><strong>Language:</strong> Python<br>
         <strong>Libraries:</strong> Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels<br>
         <strong>Techniques:</strong> SARIMA, Naive Forecasting, Moving Average</p>
